# ReportingComptable
This is my Project for the end of my studies in the Highter Institute of Management.
The company *Central Bank of Tunisia* asked us interns to creatively migrate its accountant reporting system from Oracle forms to a web plateform.
As an intern I gladly learned how to adapt to their environnement and use the technologies they asked me to use (Oracle JDeveloper 11g and Oracle DB) to display the information required and personaly added touches to further simplify reading data with jcharts.
This application can be implemented in their new information system safely and confidently with its simple algorithm to safely interrogate the database based on the user's requirement.

I hope you can give me feedback about it!
